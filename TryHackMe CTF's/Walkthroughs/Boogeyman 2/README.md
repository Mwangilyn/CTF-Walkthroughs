## Introduction  
This is my walkthrough of the Boogeyman 2 challenge from TryHackMe, the second in a series of capstone challenges for the SOC Level 1 path.  
The challenge is a multi-part DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) investigation focusing on a fictional threat actor called the Boogeyman.  

---

## Challenge Scenario  
Quick Logistics LLC suffered an attack from the Boogeyman and improved its defenses. Unfortunately, the threat actor returned with updated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  

- Maxine, an HR Specialist, received a malicious resume via email.  
- This attachment compromised her workstation.  
- The SOC team flagged suspicious commands, prompting a full DFIR investigation.  

*Task:* Analyze the artefacts, emails, and memory dump to unmask the Boogeyman’s methods.

## Walkthrough & Questions  

*Q1: What email was used to send the phishing email?*  
Opened Resume – Application for Junior IT Analyst Role.eml → found in *From:* field of email header.  

*Q2: What is the email of the victim employee?*  
Found in the *To:* field in the same header.  

*Q3: What is the name of the attached malicious document?*  
Searched for attachment in the .eml file → located filename in Content-Disposition field.  

*Q4: What is the MD5 hash of the malicious attachment?*  
Downloaded attachment → ran:  

bash
md5sum Resume_WesleyTaylor.doc
`

*Q5: What URL is used to download the stage 2 payload?*
Analyzed the document with olevba:

bash
olevba Resume_WesleyTaylor.doc


Extracted URL from VBA macros.

*Q6: What is the name of the process that executed the stage 2 payload?*
Discovered through macro execution analysis.

*Q7: What is the full file path of the malicious stage 2 payload?*
Extracted during analysis of downloaded payload from Q5.

*Q8: What is the PID of the process that executed the stage 2 payload?*
Analyzed memory dump with Volatility 3:

bash
vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.pstree


*Q9: What is the parent PID of the process that executed the stage 2 payload?*
Visible in Volatility pstree output.

*Q10: What URL is used to download the malicious binary executed by stage 2 payload?*
Dumped child process memory:

bash
vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.memmap --pid <CHILD-PID> --dump
strings pid.dmp | grep files.boogeymanisback.lol


Also confirmed via strings on full dump:

bash
strings WKSTN-2961.raw | grep files.boogeymanisback.lol


*Q11: What is the PID of the malicious process used to establish the C2 connection?*
Identified via Volatility pstree and netscan.

*Q12: What is the full file path of the malicious process used to establish the C2 connection?*
Verified with Volatility cmdline plugin.

*Q13: What is the IP and port of the C2 connection?*
Checked with Volatility netscan:

bash
vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.netscan | grep 6216


*Q14: What is the full file path of the malicious email attachment based on memory dump?*
Located in Outlook temp folder:

bash
vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.filescan | grep Resume


*Q15: What is the full command used to maintain persistence?*
Found malicious scheduled task:

bash
strings WKSTN-2961.raw | grep -i schtasks


---

## Conclusion

✅ Mission accomplished!
We confirmed that the Boogeyman gained access via a malicious email attachment, downloaded a second-stage payload, established C2 communication, and maintained persistence with a scheduled task (schtasks).

This challenge was an excellent simulation of a real-world DFIR case study, combining:

* Email analysis
* Memory forensics
* Malware investigation
* Persistence detection
